# BootCamp++

Welcome to this course on computer science. Did you graduate from a coding boot camp but you are unsure what to do and learn next? We got you covered. This course is dedicated to your learning journey of becoming a professional programmer. Here we have collected material on topics that are usually not covered at a coding boot camp. The content of this course will help you be better at your job as a programmer, perform better in job interviews and understand things you have learned previously in more detail.

## Learning Resources

### Havard CS50

The Harvard CS50 course is a renowned computer science introductory course. You will get in contact with new programming languages and concepts from computer science. This course is not only done by computer science students but also done by people from many adjacent fields like the natural sciences, business and engineering.

## About

With BootCamp++ we want to find out what learning resources are helpful for developers that are just getting started with their career. The tech industry is currently expanding drastically. This creates a great opportunity for anyone who wants to switch careers into the field. Boot camps are promising to get people into a job within a few weeks. But in reality, even if you have landed your programming job after the boot camp, your graduation only marks the start of a long learning journey.

We have the feeling that we are not talking enough about this aspect of this career switch. Boot camps are interested in selling that their program is all you will need to know. At the same time companies are not prepared to take on junior programmers of this level. These wrong expectations lead to many junior developers struggling in their first job. We want to research how we can enable both developers and employers through hand-picked learning resources, a learning community and a motivational framework.
